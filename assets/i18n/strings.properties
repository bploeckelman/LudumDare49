introText=Welcome,\n'Dole Presidente' to our beautiful island paradise of Potassia!\n\nWe know you'll manage our island well.\n\nLets take a look around...
reactorText=\nThis is your nuclear reactor tower.\n\nIt's poorly constructed and unstable, so it needs constant supervision.\n\nKeep an eye on your control panel at all times!
heatText=\nThe meter at the bottom left\ntracks the temperature level of the reactor.\n\nIf it gets too hot it will explode!\n\nThat would be bad.
structureText=\nThe meter at the bottom right\ntracks the structural integrity of the reactor.\n\nIf it takes too much damage it will explode!\n\n...please try not to hit it with anything.
pistonText=\nThese are your control rods.\nThey keep your reactor temperature stable\nso it doesn't melt down.\n\nThe reactor pressure is\nconstantly pushing them up.\n\nThrow junk in to push them back down!
slingText=\nYou can use this banana hammock to launch whatever junk you can find laying around into the reactor.\n\nClick on it and pull down to prepare,\nrelease to launch!\n\nIf you don't keep the control rods down,\nthe reactor will overheat and meltdown!
ammoText=\nThis is your 'strategic junk stockpile'...\nI mean 'ammo reserve'.\n\nYou'll run out of junk eventually and have to buy more to toss into the reactor.\n\nSo save your pennies!
griftText=\nThis is your exploitation station.\n\nIt's where you 'earn' your money\n(on the backs of the banana citizenry).\n\nWhen the meter fills up, you get paid.\nSpend some money to get paid faster!
repairText=\nThis is where you repair your reactor tower.\n\nIt's expensive,\nhopefully you don't need to use it much!
ciaText=\nOh no! It looks like the CIA is here\nto destabilize your country.\n\nPay them off or they will\nincite a mob to attack your reactor!
